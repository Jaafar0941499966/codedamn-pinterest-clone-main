Starter Code:
The code provided already sets up the client and the server. The GraphQL setup is done and one type is already created (the user type). Use the starter code provides a good start to the project, but you will need to do a lot on your own. If you are wondering how to structure the project, I put some pictures of mine Pinterest clone down below.
